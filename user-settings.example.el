;; But if you want to create this two terminals with some predefined commands, open with SPC T and define the commands here:
;; (setq +vterm-command-terms '("docker-compose up" nil)) ;; Each element of the list is one terminal.  nil creates an empty terminal.

;; To test a new font, press M-x (alt + x) and search for reload-user-settings

;; By default, the value of debugger is require 'pry'; binding.pry.  To change, uncomment and modify the variable below:

(setq ruby-docker-compose-cwd "/app/")
(setq ruby-docker-compose-container "web")

;; Tip here:  You can use M-x rbenv-use and select one version that has solargraph.  You can also install with apt or brew.
(setq ruby-docker-disable-solargraph nil) ;; If you want to disable solargraph, change to t.  PS:  You can use solargraph by removing .ruby-version of your project and using from rbenv.

;; To have always docker mode on, just uncomment:
;; (use-ruby-docker) ;; <<<<<<<< UNCOMMENT HERE TO USE DOCKER

;; You can also call M-x disable-ruby-docker to go back to ruby on machine.  You can call M-x use-ruby-docker whatever you want.
